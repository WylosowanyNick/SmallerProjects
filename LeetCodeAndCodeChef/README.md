# LeetCode and CodeChef

This project contains source codes written by me to practice problem solving and coding in Python and Cpp.

Back in time I started practicing problem solving and coding by solving problems from CodeChef. I used to code solutions of these problems in Python. With time I started to realise, that Python lacks something (in other words abstracts too much from me). So I began to solve problems using Cpp. With time however I felt, that problems from CodeChef didn't suit me, as they appeared as easy to me. So I started solving problems from LeetCode.
